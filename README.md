The written analysis has the following:
Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to determine and display competency in Microsoft Excel by showcasing our ability to organize and visualize data through: filtering, conditional formatting, pivot tables, charting, VLOOKUP’s (and other functions), and measures of central tendency.
Analysis and Challenges
I performed analysis through several methods on excel such as:
While completing the IFERROR() formula I received this error → #NAME? Trouble shooting that was inciteful, helped me identify mistake in my formula.

Module 1.4.2: I had trouble coding when I imputed =VLOOKUP(A2, KickStarter!B:P, 5, FALSE) and I did not get a proper value for Avg Donation and backers_count

.At one point in time I encountered this error with GitHub in uploading to the repository as I did not offload data from an excel sheet as I should have. This really taught me to pay attention to the minutia in directions when presented.

Results
Theater Outcomes by Launch Date: The total number of successes was nearly double that of failures. With cancellations only at 37.
Outcomes based on Goals: The number of attempts (success/failure) were much higher with lower goals, when goals increased the successes/failures decreased as well non-linearly, however, there were no acnelations throughout.
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for additional tables or graphs (2 pt). The data abnalyzed is limited and there may be confounding variables (like the weather) that could account for the drastic changes in in outcomes. Additional tables can be made to account for weather and donations.
